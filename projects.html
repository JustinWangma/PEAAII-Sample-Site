    <h2><a>Professor Chen's Project: AI For Nature: Building a Wildlife Image Classifier</a></h2>
    <p>In this 3-week summer camp project, students will explore how artificial intelligence can help protect wildlife through image classification. Participants will learn the basics of machine learning and computer vision by building a simple AI model that can identify different species of animals from photos taken in nature reserves or camera traps. The project starts with an introduction to Python and AI fundamentals, including data labeling, neural networks, and model training. Students will work in teams to collect and clean datasets, train image classifiers using platforms like TensorFlow, and evaluate model performance. They will also explore real-world applications of AI in conservation and reflect on ethical considerations, such as bias in data and the importance of preserving biodiversity. By the end of the camp, students will present their models and findings in a final showcase, demonstrating how AI can be used for positive environmental impact. No prior coding experience is required—just curiosity and a willingness to learn.

    <h2><a>Professor Liang's Project: AI Agents for Usable and Accurate Dietary Assessment (UADA)</a></h2>
    <p>Are you interested in AI, mobile apps, and making a real impact on older adults' health? Join our exciting 3-week summer camp project to help build the next-generation UADA app—a smart dietary assessment tool that combines Voice AI and Visual AI to help seniors easily track what they eat. Traditional tools like the ASA-24 are long, complicated, and not friendly to older users. Our UADA app is different: it uses natural voice conversations powered by large language models and realistic food visuals generated by cutting-edge AI to make food tracking simple, accurate, and even fun. You’ll get hands-on experience with automatic speech recognition (ASR), LLM customization (like OpenAI’s GPT or Whisper), and image generation models, all while contributing to a meaningful healthcare project. You’ll also learn how AI can be applied to solve real-world problems in geriatric health and human-centered design. Whether you’re into coding, AI, UX/UI design, or just want to explore healthcare technology, this project welcomes students of all backgrounds.

    <h2><a>Professor Pei's Project: Smart Connections: Building a Friend Recommendation AI</a></h2>
    <p>Have you ever wondered how apps like Snapchat or Instagram suggest people you might know? In this 3-week summer camp project, you’ll build your own mini version of that system—powered by AI. By modeling friendships as a network of connections, you’ll train an AI to spot hidden patterns and recommend new friends, just like real-world social platforms do. You’ll begin with a beginner-friendly introduction to Python and AI concepts, including how to work with networks, analyze connections, and build simple predictive models. Then, using real-world data, you’ll design and train your own AI-powered friend recommender. Along the way, you’ll explore powerful tools like NetworkX for network analysis and scikit-learn for model training. Beyond coding, this project also invites you to think critically: What happens when AI influences who we talk to online? Can friend suggestions reinforce echo chambers? You’ll learn not only how these systems work, but also how to build them responsibly. At the end of the camp, you’ll present your personalized system and share what you’ve learned about the intersection of technology, society, and human connection.

  <h2><a href="#">Professor Wan's Project: AI Model Hub: Building a Universal Gateway for Multiple AI Systems</a></h2>
  <p>In this hands-on project, students will design and build an AI gateway system that serves as a central hub for accessing multiple AI models through a single, unified interface. Students will learn to integrate various AI services including OpenAI, Claude, and Google's Gemini through their APIs, while also implementing support for locally-run open-source models like Llama. Through this project, students will gain practical experience in API integration, software architecture, user interface design, and the deployment of AI systems, while developing a deeper understanding of how different AI models compare in capabilities and use cases. By the end of the project, students will build a functional AI gateway that demonstrates real-world software engineering skills and showcases their ability to work with cutting-edge AI technologies.</p>
